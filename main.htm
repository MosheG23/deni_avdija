                    <h4>Maccabi Tel-Aviv (2017-2020)</h4>
                    <p>
                        On 5 November 2017, Avdija started his professional career with Maccabi Tel Aviv, signing a six-year deal with the
                        club. On 19 November, he made his professional debut in the Israeli Premier League, playing three minutes against
                        Ironi Nes Ziona. At 16 years and 320 days of age, he became the youngest player to ever play for his club's senior
                        team. Avdija made his EuroLeague debut on 22 November 2018, at the age of 17, in a 74–70 loss to Fenerbahçe. He
                        scored two points in three minutes of playing time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On 24 October 2019, at the age of 18, Avdija made his first start in the EuroLeague, recording six points and three
                        rebounds in 16 minutes in a 76–63 victory over Valencia. On 11 January 2020, Avdija recorded a then career-high of
                        22 points, shooting 9-of-15 from the field, and five assists in a 94–83 win over Hapoel Holon. On 31 January 2020,
                        Avdija was named Israeli Player of the Month in the Israeli League after averaging 14.5 points, 5.3 rebounds and 2.5
                        assists per game, with an 18.3 PIR, in four games played that month. On 1 February 2020, Avdija established a new
                        career-high of 26 points, shooting 9-of-12 from the field, and grabbed six rebounds in an 86–81 loss to Hapoel
                        Eilat. Six days later, he scored 13 points, including eight in the second quarter, in a 78–77 victory over
                        Fenerbahçe. His dunk over Luigi Datome during the game would be named EuroLeague Magic Moment of the Season in July
                        2020. On 16 April, Avdija declared for the 2020 NBA draft.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Avdija's season was suspended for about three months due to the COVID-19 pandemic. He returned to action on 21 June,
                        recording 23 points, seven rebounds and five assists in 24 minutes in a 114–82 win over Maccabi Ashdod. On 23 July,
                        he scored 22 points, including 10 in the fourth quarter, and grabbed 10 rebounds in an 83–68 win over Hapoel Tel Aviv,
                        helping Maccabi Tel Aviv advance to the Israeli League Final Four. In the Final on 28 July, Avdija recorded five
                        points, seven rebounds, four assists and two steals to help Maccabi Tel Aviv defeat Maccabi Rishon LeZion, 86–81. He
                        became the youngest player to ever win the Israeli League MVP award. Avdija was also named Israeli League Israeli
                        Player of the Year and was an All-Israeli League First Team selection. He finished the season averaging 12.9 points,
                        6.3 rebounds and 2.7 assists per game in the Israeli League. In the EuroLeague, Avdija averaged four points, 2.6
                        rebounds and 1.2 assists in 14.3 minutes per game.

                    <p>
                        During summer 2020 he parted ways with Maccabi Tel Aviv and entered to the 2020 NBA draft.

                    <h4>National Team</h4>
                    <h5>Junior team</h5>
                    <p>
                        Although he had also been eligible to represent Serbia internationally, due to his father's background, Avdija chose to
                        play for Israel because he had friends there and was more familiar with its language. He competed for Israel at the
                        2017 FIBA U16 European Championship in Podgorica. Avdija led the tournament with 12.6 rebounds and 5.3 assists per game,
                        to go with 15.3 points per game.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In April 2018, Avdija averaged over 17 points and nine rebounds for Israel at the Albert Schweitzer Tournament, an
                        under-18 competition in Mannheim. In July 2018, he played at the FIBA U20 European Championship in Chemnitz, leading
                        Israel to a gold medal. Avdija averaged 12.7 points, 6.4 rebounds, 1.1 assists and 1.3 steals per game, while earning a
                        spot on the all-tournament team with teammate Yovel Zoosman. Later that month, Avdija competed at the FIBA U18
                        European Championship Division B in Skopje. Appearing tired from his previous tournament and lacking in endurance, he
                        averaged 17.3 points, 7.4 rebounds, 3 assists and 1.4 steals per game.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In July 2019, Avdija led Israel to a second straight gold medal at the FIBA U20 European Championship in Tel Aviv. He
                        averaged 18.4 points, 8.3 rebounds, 5.3 assists, 2.4 blocks and 2.1 steals per game, earning MVP and all-tournament team
                        accolades, as the second-youngest player at the event. Avdija tallied 26 points, 11 rebounds and 5 steals
                        against France in the semifinal, before recording 23 points, 7 assists, 5 rebounds and 3 blocks against Spain in the
                        final.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Senior team</h5>
                    <p>
                        On 21 February 2019, Avdija made his debut for the Israeli senior national team, in an 81–77 win over Germany, during
                        the 2019 FIBA World Cup qualification stage. On 24 February 2020, he recorded 21 points and eight rebounds in 24
                        minutes in an 87–63 victory over Romania during the EuroBasket 2021 qualifiers.
